## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

1. Open the link above
2. Duplicate this file to your Collaboratory
3. Go through the contents of the file carefully:
    - Annotate every function, class, and line carefully. You must add comments to all the cells to explain exactly what that cell does (the quality of comments will add to the score)
    - in the cell where the main model is defined: fill in the blank for the r_in, n_in, etc.
    - run each cell one by one experiment
    - Once you're done with your experiments, then attempt S2 Assignment
    - You'll have 45 minutes to answer the questions asked about the code you just commented on and annotate
5. You'll be running the code once/twice during these 45 minutes (before attempting the Assignment, try and play around in another duplicate file)
6. Read the Assignment Questions carefully before attempting the questions
7. Negative Score for BAD file name

## ðŸ“š Introduction

The code for this assignment loads the MNIST data, builds a naive model and trains the model on the loaded data. The code can be found [here](./Session2_Fix_Error.ipynb).
